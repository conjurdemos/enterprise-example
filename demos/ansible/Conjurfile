            The EC2 SSH key which is the initial root credential for created hosts.
            When a new host is created, this key is stored in a variable that is unique to that host.
            The SSH key rotator can then be used to periodically rotate the unique root SSH key
            for that host.

            Stores a Host Factory token for the prod/frontend/v1 layer. When a new host is created
            for the frontend, Ansible fetches the host factory token from this variable and passes
            it to the host. The host uses the token to perform identity bootstrap. By using 
            host factory tokens, Ansible does not have to have a "master" role which is a superset
            of all application roles. It just needs access to a set of rotating host factory tokens.
